    abstract = "Clinical trials provide essential guidance for practicing Evidence-Based Medicine, though often accompanying with unendurable costs and risks. To optimize the design of clinical trials, we introduce a novel Clinical Trial Result Prediction (CTRP) task. In the CTRP framework, a model takes a PICO-formatted clinical trial proposal with its background as input and predicts the result, i.e. how the Intervention group compares with the Comparison group in terms of the measured Outcome in the studied Population. While structured clinical evidence is prohibitively expensive for manual collection, we exploit large-scale unstructured sentences from medical literature that implicitly contain PICOs and results as evidence. Specifically, we pre-train a model to predict the disentangled results from such implicit evidence and fine-tune the model with limited data on the downstream datasets. Experiments on the benchmark Evidence Integration dataset show that the proposed model outperforms the baselines by large margins, e.g., with a 10.7{\%} relative gain over BioBERT in macro-F1. Moreover, the performance improvement is also validated on another dataset composed of clinical trials related to COVID-19.",

# Data
The ```./evidence_integration``` directory stores the Evidence Integration dataset. Evidence Integration is generated by re-purposing an existing dataset, Evidence Inference v1.0 ([Lehman et al, 2019](http://evidence-inference.ebm-nlp.com/)). Materials from Evidence Inference are stored in ```./evidence_ingreation/materials.zip```. To generate the dataset, Run:
```bash
cd evidence_integration
unzip materials.zip
python generate_evidence_integration.py 
```
This will generate the standard Evdience Integration dataset splits (```train.json```, ```validation.json``` and ```test.json```).

To run our model scripts, further process the dataset splits by running:
```bash
python index_dataset.py
```
This will generate ```indexed_[split]_picos.json``` and ```indexed_[split]_ctxs.json``` for each split.

# Pre-training Data
First, download and ungunzip all the PubMed baseline splits at <ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/baseline/>. Run:
```bash
cd pretraining_dataset
python preprocess_pubmed_splits.py
```
to parse the xml files and generate the json files for each split.

Then run:
``` bash
python tag_dataset.py # Stanford POS tagger is required to run this script. This will generate collected implicit evidence and contexts in the ./evidence repo.
python process_tages.py # This will process and aggregate all collected evidence
python aggregate_ctxs.py # This will process and aggregate all collected contexts
```
These will generate the final pretraining evidence data ```evidence.json``` and the corresponding contexts ```pmid2ctx.json```.

To run the pretraining scripts, further process the evidence by running:
```bash
python index_dataset.py
```
to generate ```indexed_evidence.json``` and ```indexed_contexts.json``` for pre-training.

# Configuration

The computing enviroment is shown in ```requirements.txt```.  

# Usage
The codes are modified from Huggingfaces' Transformers package.
